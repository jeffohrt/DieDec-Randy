The original court recordings were given to me as VOX files, with an included VOX player app, on CDs.
These files are simply too large to post the originals.
These files require some technical skills to download, install and use the player.
Some people don't have these skills.

CD's of the original VOX files can be purchased at the Bridgewater Courthouse.
That's where and how I got them.

--------------------------------------------------
The original VOX recordings could not be posted to the repo because of their size and complexity of use.
Converting them to MP4 cost too much money.
So I set one machine to play and another to record.
There's an echo but they are M4A - the preferred format for Apple machines.
The July 22nd court date file was too large VOX or the courthouse split it into 3, 1 hr files.
That was still too large and it cost money to split M4A files.  I did not have an app to do it.

The M4A files were converted to MP3 by a free service on the internet.

The VOX files are the originals.
The M4A files are copies of the originals.
The MP3 files are copies of copies.

The MP3 files are still too large to upload to the repo and had to be split again.

MP3 files can be dragged and dropped into a browser to listen to them (if you don't have a music player app).
