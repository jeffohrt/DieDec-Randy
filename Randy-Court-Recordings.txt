The original court recordings were given to me as VOX files, with an included VOX player on CD.
These files are simply too large to post the originals.
These files require some technical skills to download, install and use the player.
Some people don't have these skills.

--------------------------------------------------
The original VOX recordings  could not be posted to the repo because of their size and complexity of use.
Converting them to MP4 cost too much money.
So I set one machine to play and another to record.
There's an echo but they are M4A - the preferred format for Apple machines.
The July 22nd court date file was too large and I split it into 3, 1 hr files.
That was still too large, so I split them into 1 file per witness.

M4A files can be dragged and dropped into a browser to listen to them.
