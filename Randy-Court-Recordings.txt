--------------------------------------------
The original court recordings are stored in https://github.com/jeffohrt/DieDec-Randy-Court-VOX
They are very large and can only be played (with the included VOX player) on a Windows machince.
Don't ask me ... that's how the courts gave them to me.



The original VOX recordings require technical skills to play back (installing, navigating and operating a VOX player)
Converting them to MP4 cost too much money.
So I set one machine to play and another to record.
There's an echo but they are M4A - the preferred format for Apple machines.
The July 22nd court date file was too large and I split it into 3, 1 hr files.
That was still too large, so I split them into 1 file per witness.
