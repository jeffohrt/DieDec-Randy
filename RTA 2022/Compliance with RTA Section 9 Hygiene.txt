I am asking the Director to enforce the By-Law inspection of all 4 apartments and the property as described in my By-Law documents (provided) under RTA Section 9 (Good Behavior, Non-Interference, Hygiene and Cleanliness).

I am asking the Director to enforce the dumpster request outlined in the By-Law documents to remove the literal metric tons of garbage, broken furniture and appliances stored in Mr. Wambolt’s apartment (1), the porch, basement and backyard.  Apartments 3 and 4 are in a biohazard level of unsanitary conditions owing to the tenants physical and medical challenges, hording and general lack of hygiene.

An unknown liquid - from the bathroom area of apartment 4, has been leaking into my apartment since Dec 2021.  An 8 ft section of ceiling has fallen in - damaging and destroying many of my possessions.

A full explanation is the email / document I sent to Burt Long, the property owner on Jan 25th 2022, making the identical requests.

Mr. Wambolt’s illegal income streams involve the collection and storage of literal metric tons of garbage, broken furniture and appliances.  He defends this ‘resource’ violently.

I am asking the Director to ban Mr. Wambolt from the storage and cleaning of recycling at the property as the smell in the summer is overwhelming - and regardless of the season - Mr. Wambolt rinses the garbage and food wastes of thousands of bottles from several dozen homes - in the parking lot and backyard.
