I am asking the Director to assign my funds to a trust for the purposes of extending my lease and paying my rent until 3 months after my death.

I would like my security deposit returned to that trust.

Upon my death, assuming my lease is extended and my rent is paid, and there is some positive balance including the security deposit, I would like those funds (stored in a trust) to be given to the friends assisting with my end of life care.

They will be the ones to finish cleaning and packing my apartment.
