Crystal Wambolt is Randy Wambolt’s wife.  They both live in Apartment 1.

Crystal has some form of aggressive dementia.  Mr. Wambolt has lied so often about what it is and what it means - no one really knows.

Mr. Wambolt is a violent domestic abuser of Crystal - that is not the focus of this document.

From Aug 2020 to April 2021 - I had an agreement with George Wambolt - Randy and Crystal’s son - I would not report Randy to the police or have him evicted - if I was left alone.

Mr. Wambolt privately tortured his wife to force his son to withdraw that help.  This is not domestic violence - because I am not a family member.  This is coercion and extortion.

When court documents and subpoenas were served in April 2021 - Mr. Wambolt made 2 threats of mass shootings and publicly tortured his ailing wife to prevent his son from testifying in court on my behalf.

Crystal Wambolt was publicly tortured for 4 months (April - July) including in court on July 7th.

All public torture of Crystal ended when Mr. Wambolt learned I was dying on July 22nd.

My landlords are aware these events have occurred.  They have seen public abuses of Crystal Wambolt that continue to the present.

I am asking the Director to enforce the reporting of the abuse and exploitation of Crystal Wambolt as a vulnerable member of society under Sections 10 (Imminent Threats) and Section 9 (Good Behavior, Non-Interference and Hygiene).
