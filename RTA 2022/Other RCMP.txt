Some local RCMP have treated me so abhorrently that :

	•	they have refused to take witness statements concerning 2 threats of mass shootings
	•	they have refused to take witness statements concerning violent assaults with weapons going back 11 years
	•	they have refused to come to the property to address a domestic violence situation
	•	they have refused to come to the property to address a mental health crisis with with mentally challenged minor
	•	they have refused to come to the property to address the violent assault of my landlord in a Bridgewater courthouse waiting room
	•	they have refused to interview witnesses to the general harassment of the entire community

Some local RCMP are so frustrated, their disdain and contempt for the tenants of my building are palpable.

My treatment by some RCMP - who can only say the name Randy Wambolt - has been so abusive and harassing that I haven’t bothered to report an attempt on my life.

I wrote directly to SIRT and RCMP Major Crimes.

I have written Burt Long - the property owner - asking him to speak with the RCMP.  It is not safe in my building and that is exasperated by the knowledge the RCMP won’t come when I call for help.

My response to asking for help - Form D - slid under my door.

I am asking the Director, under whatever provisions of the RTA cover both general safety and Section 10 (Imminent Threats), that some action or documentation be taken to ensure the RCMP can not refuse to come to my building in the future.
