Fay Munroe is the tenant in Apartment 3.  She is disabled or challenged in every facet of life that there is.  She can also be hateful, ignorant and petty.

Mrs. Munroe has been the victim of extreme domestic violence from her common law husband for an unknown period of time.  The CL husband was removed from the property - with both parties receiving 1 year peace bonds shortly before I moved in, in April 2019.  The CL husband returned in the spring of 2020 - Mr. Wambolt reported him to the RCMP in an argument with Mrs Munroe over a chair and whether she was allowed on the porch.  The CL husband was removed for a month the same week of court (July 22nd).

Mr. Wambolt has exploited and abused Mrs Munroe for the 5 years she has lived in the building.  He has capitalized on her domestic violence circumstances and in March and April of 2021 - abused her by befriending her and giving her access to the porch - if and only if - she file complaints against me.

This abuse and exploitation grew exponentially, our landlords asking me in April 2021 if I felt it was elder abuse - I said no - it was worse.

That same question has come up again and again.

Mrs Munroe has now lied under oath - to conceal 5 years of abuse, harassment and threats from Mr. Wambolt.  She has lied under oath to conceal 2 threats of mass shootings.  She has lied under oath to conceal the abuse and torture of Crystal Wambolt.

All because Mrs Munroe believes this level of violence is normal.

I am asking the Director to enforce the reporting of Mr. Wamboltâ€™s abuse and exploitation of a vulnerable member of society by the landlords - they are aware of much more than myself - under Section 10 - Imminent Threat and Section 9 - Good Behavior and Non-Interference.
