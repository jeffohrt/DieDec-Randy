I have not had a safe, clean place to live since July 2020.

I have been assaulted, with weapons, harassed and threatened on a daily basis since Sept 2020.  My guests have been subjected to the same treatment.  Mr. Wambolt has used everything from screwdrivers to a chainsaw.

My possessions were stolen to sabotage my employment on multiple occasions.  A client’s possessions were severely damaged.  My tools have been stolen.  My canoe was threatened (tools of my trade).

There were 2 threats of mass shootings (April 9th and May 29th 2021).

A tenant was tortured for 4 months to prevent her son from testifying in court on my behalf.

Barricades were built.  Fire exits were blocked.  Walkways and exits were sabotaged.  Garbage, broken furniture and appliances are stored everywhere.

There was a 3 month long attempt on my life from July 23rd 2021 to November 2021.

From late April 2019 to April 2021, 2 full years, my powerbill, for a single room apartment, was $200 (summer) and $300 (winter) per month  or $2500 a year.  My landlords regularly told me they run their entire house on less than that.  I kept my landlords apprised of the power consumption situation.  It took a long time to track the power consumption to the stove (mid 2020) - I returned the stove - not needing it as I was cooking and eating on the porch twice a day as I had for over a year.  This dropped my powerbill a small amount.  It took even longer to find the faulty fridge was responsible for the lion's share - as I was unable to live in my apartment from Sept 2020 to April 2021 due to the extreme violence of Mr. Wambolt.  I was gone for so long - that Mr. Wambolt began circulating the rumors I had moved away.

In April of 2021 - removing the fridge from my apartment is what spurred the violence leading to an RCMP report and a peace bond application.

From April of 2021 t0 present my summer time powerbill is less than $50 a month.  My winter time powerbill is $100-$120 depending on how often I can risk coming to my apartment.

My powerbill from April 2019 to January 2022 is more than $7000 - due to the faulty appliances, removal of the insulation on one entire side of my apartment by Mr. Wambolt for the winter of 2021/22 and the use of electric heat.

I have paid 16 months (Aug 2020 - Dec 2021 inclusive) of rent ($450) and been unable to live in, stay or enjoy my apartment.  That is $7200.

I have been forced to eat out - unable to eat at my own apartment because I am attacked every time I leave my apartment.  For medical reasons - I cook and eat outside.

All of my expenses are compounded by these events taking place during the height of COVID.

I have had to live with friends, on average, 15-20 days a month - for 18 months (Aug 2020 - Feb 2022 inclusive).  They live several communities away and while they don’t charge me rent - I’ve had to pay $2-300 a month in gas.  That is $3000 - $6000.

The peace bond process, in which Mr. Wambolt, Mr. Oickle, and Mrs Munroe lied so blatantly about the extreme violence in our building cost me more than $600.  That is just gas to Bridgewater 15 times for subpoena paperwork (7-9 subpoenas issued 3 times), 4 court dates and document production.

Just this brief accounting is $18000 - $20000 in rent and utilities, that I have spent - and not received what I paid for - a safe, clean place to live and to be left alone.

I would like the Director to award what they believe is a fair portion (some, most or all) to myself for food and a trust to pay my rent for the amount of time that amount will allow - or until my death + 3 months.

Any balance after that time - I would like returned to the friends providing my end of life care.  They will also be the ones cleaning and packing the apartment after my death.
