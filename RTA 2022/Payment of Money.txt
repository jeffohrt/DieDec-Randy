I have not had a safe, clean place to live since July 2020.

I have been assaulted, with weapons, harassed and threatened on a daily basis since Sept 2020.  My guests have been subjected to the same treatment.  Mr. Wambolt has used everything from screwdrivers to a chainsaw.

My possessions were stolen to sabotage my employment on multiple occasions.  A client’s possessions were severely damaged.  My tools have been stolen.  My canoe was threatened (tools of my trade).

There were 2 threats of mass shootings (April 9th and May 29th 2021).

A tenant was tortured for 4 months to prevent her son from testifying in court on my behalf.

Barricades are built.  Fire exits are blocked.  Walkways and exits are sabotaged.  Garbage, broken furniture and appliances are stored everywhere.

There was a 3 month long attempt on my life from July 23rd 2021 to November 2021.

I have paid 16 months (Aug 2020 - Dec 2021 inclusive) of rent ($450) and utilities ($150) and been unable to live in, stay or enjoy my apartment.  That is $8800.

I have been forced to eat out - unable to eat at my own apartment because I am attacked every time I leave my apartment.  For medical reasons - I cook and eat outside.

All of my expenses are compounded by these events taking place during the height of COVID.

I have had to live with friends, on average, 15-20 days a month - for 18 months (Aug 2020 - Feb 2022 inclusive).  They live several communities away and while they don’t charge me rent - I’ve had to pay $2-300 a month in gas.  That is $3000 - $6000.

The peace bond process, in which Mr. Wambolt, Mr. Oickle, and Mrs Munroe lied so blatantly about the extreme violence in our building cost me more than $600.  That is just gas to Bridgewater 15 times for subpoena paperwork (7-9 subpoenas issued 3 times), 4 court dates and document production.

Just this brief accounting is $12000 to $15000 I have spent - and not received what I paid for - a safe, clean place to live and to be left alone.

I would like the Director to award what they believe is a fair portion (some, most or all) to myself for food and a trust to pay my rent for the amount of time that amount will allow - or until my death + 3 months.

Any balance after that time - I would like returned to the friends providing my end of life care.  They will also be the ones cleaning and packing the apartment after my death.
