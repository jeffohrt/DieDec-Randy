I am writing to request that the Director set a hearing, if it occurs, to last more than 1 hour (as described in the documentation).

Alternatively, I am writing to request that the Director or the RTO assigned, consider breaking my single application into multiple applications - each with it's own separate ability to be mediated, settled or assigned to a hearing of 1 hour each.

My preference is for multiple applications as the sheer magnitude of violence to be discussed can easily overshadow and disadvantage other issues that are equally deserving of an hour of everyone's time.
