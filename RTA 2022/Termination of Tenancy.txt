I am dying.  I have little time left.  My death is a rape / homicide.  I have notified the Nova Scotia Serious Incident Response Team (SIRT 1 doc included) and the RCMP Major Crimes (SIRT 1 doc included).

I am asking the Director to review my case, to determine what portions of my rent and exceptional expenses (Aug 2020 - present) be placed in trust to pay my rent and utilities until my death and for a period of 3 months (finances allowing) after my death.

If my financial situation improves, I would also like to contribute to this trust for the purpose of extending my lease until 3 months after my death.

I am asking that, if awarded sufficient funds, my lease be extended and rent be paid until 3 months after my death for 2 reasons :

I do not know the specific date of my death.  My health is rapidly declining.

I have only 2 close friends.  I would like them to have time to grieve without worrying about my estate.  I would like them to have time to clear and clean my apartment after my death.

I have begun the process of cleaning and packing my apartment in preparation of my own death.

This process has been greatly hindered by the circumstances I have been forced to live in.

I am asking the Director to make special note (in writing) that my friends be given access to my apartment after my death.  Mr. Wambolt has threatened these people with and without weapons for more than 18 months.  He as repeatedly attacked, harassed and barricaded them from the property, endangering them, their vehicle and their son.  Mr. Wambolt has falsely reported them to the RCMP for trespass when they came to visit me in Dec 2021.  I have no doubt he will report them to the RCMP after my death, as they manage my estate.
