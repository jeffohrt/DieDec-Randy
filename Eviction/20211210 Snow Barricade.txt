In the Images folder there are 3 photographs from Dec 10th 2021.

Randy (and possibly others) shoveled all the snow they could easily get into the driveway in front of my apartment, onto the walkway by my apartment and blocking in the entire "cage" Randy and Wayne built.

Randy endangered every other tenant, all first responders (firefighters, paramedics) etc, when he buried the only entrance / exit to 3 apartments in 4 feet snow and ice.

This snow barricade and the cage made it extremely dangerous and slippery for all tenants in apartments 2,3 and 4 to enter and exit the building.

This was done specifically to harass me because Randy has known since I move in, in 2019, my health does not allow me to shovel snow.

Randy and Wayne both swore under oath they've never done this (court recordings).  That no-one has ever barricaded or endangered other tenants in general or with snow and ice specifically (court recordings).

Randy did this multiple times in the previous winter.  Under oath he swore he never did it, that Cheezy did it, that he (Randy) called George (Randy's son) to ask him to plough me out.  George did - out of embarassement.  His father never called and asked.

Under oath - Fay testified Randy buried my car multiple times, particularly with the snow blower and specifically it was not Cheezy.  Berle testified Randy buried my car (and others) with the snow blower.
