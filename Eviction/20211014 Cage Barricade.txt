During court (July 22nd) Randy, Fay and Wayne all testified, under oath, Randy has never attacked tenants, never harassed them, never used his furniture to form barricades and force people off the porch.

When shown photographs in court all 3 repeated that 'those' were not barricades.  They were furniture.  The photos, testimony and landlords' eye witness reports show and explain Randy's furniture included a stackable washer dryer, a KFC 4 person dining table with fixed seating, and industrial photocopier, lumber, plywood and a full sized CPR dummy just during the 7 months from Sept 2020 to April 2021 - when Randy began attacking myself and my guests with weapons and barricades.

During the bear hide incident, on or around October 13th or 14th, Randy and Wayne built a 4 ft by 10 ft chainlink cage.  It is nailed into the rafters, main beams of the porch and the porch itself.  It has damaged damaged everything it has been nailed to including the siding on the house.  No permits were obtained.  No landlords were consulted.  Neighbors have called Burt Long, the property owner, in New Brunswick to complain.

This is all occurring during the months I am being attacked day and night with Randy yelling at me :
