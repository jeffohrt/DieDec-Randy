On July 22nd, 2021, Randy Wambolt testified (recordings are in the Court Recordings folder) under oath he never threatened to shoot everyone on May 29th, that he had never said anything like that ever.  He testified that he only threatened to shoot himself.

Randy threatened to shoot everyone in the building on April 9th.  His landlords made a written note of it in his file.  They were so upset by the the court proceedings and Randy's offensive conduct in and out of court, that they didn't know how to bring it up it court and eventually forgot about it (in the moment) because I never brought it up.  I didn't know about the April 9th threats until July 25th.

Randy Wambolt testified that he doesn't know where to get guns, that he doesn't have access to and is afraid of guns.  He lied, and minutes later testified he knew both where his son's guns were but also where he believed mine were.  He testified that he doesn't know where the keys to his son's guns are.  Randy is a liar.  Randy showed me his son's guns in 2020, he unlocked them for me to handle them to try to impress me.  At that time they were stored with cable locks in a machine shop.  In 2021 there were a dozen tools within reach of the gun safe that can cut cable locks.

Randy Wambolt testified that I sleep on my guns; that I keep my guns with my Kraft Dinner.  So he did believe he knew where to access guns.  His landlord testified he has broken into apartments before.

My firearms are work related and stored at my place of work (not my residence) when I am working.

When I am not working they are trigger locked with combination locks and locked in a gun safe as per RCMP requirements.
