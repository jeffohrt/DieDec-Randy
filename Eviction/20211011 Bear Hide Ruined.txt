It is common knowledge I use to hunt and trap as an income.  In 2021, the attempts on my life in August damaged my right (dominant) hand and arm.  I was unable to hunt or trap that fall / winter.  I will never get full use of my hand back.

I tried to earn a little money by repairing a bear hide I had helped a family turn into a rug the year before.  It was wet and had been damaged.

The hide was placed on the porch with my possessions that were used to make a work table on October 11th - leather side up, covered in sawdust to dry moisture out of it before the repair.  There are photos in the Images folder.

Randy (and others) flipped the hide, spilling sawdust everywhere.  The hide was damaged and torn even worse than when I received it.  It was thrown into a ball on the work table I had set up and the mess was left for tenants to track into the building and driveway.  There are photos in the Images folder.

My friends and I found the damage on Oct 12th.  Randy came running out of the house to see my reaction when he heard the car pull in, when he saw it was Chase - the husband of the woman Randy attacked for over a year, Randy ran back into the house.

I removed the bear hide on Oct 15th because Randy and Wayne built the cage in the same spot on the 13th or 14th.

The owner of the hide came to Liverpool several days later to confront Randy.  The coward ran and hid from a 5 ft, 60 yr old woman.

When the other tenants were laughing and teasing Randy for running from such a small woman, he waited until I was in the driveway to tell them :

"Fuck him, he shouldn't have left it on the porch."
