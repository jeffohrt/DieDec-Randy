During the entire frozen pipe fiasco, Wayne flooded his apartment, according to Art Long.

The leaks from Wayne's apartment caused a 2.5 ft x 2.5 ft section of my ceiling to collapse in Dec 2021.

In January 2022, during the flooding / frozen pipe fiasco - Wayne, according to the landlords, overflowed his sink.

The resulting water damage took out an 8 ft section of my ceiling over a period of days and weeks.
