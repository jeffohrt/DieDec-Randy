Sometime in late December or early January Fay (Apt 3) was having major plumbing work done, by a real plumber.

I brought the plumber into my apartment long enough to show him all the water damage from Wayne's apartment.  He said he was only being paid to fix Fay's apartment.

The entirety of Fay's garbage from those bathroom repairs was brought down and placed 'in the cage'.

Randy and Wayne stood outside my door on multiple occassions laughing and swearing at me through the door - "the fucking garbage stays with the fucking garbage" and "Fuck him, fuck his apartment - we can put this (garbage) anywhere we like - he doesn't own the porch."

My landlords were told - and the garbage barricade was left in the only space I had for 2-3 months.

It was removed in mid February.
