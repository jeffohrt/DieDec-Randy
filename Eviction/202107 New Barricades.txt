For 2 years, April 2019 to July 2021, I listened to Randy argue with my landlords about screening in the porch.  He was forbidden from doing it.

In July 2021, when Randy learned his landlords were testifying to what they could see from their porch and that they were leaving at the end of the month, for a couple of months, Randy screened in the end of the porch.  He built a barricade, only days after he, Fay and Wayne testified he never built barricades.  He waited until his landlords left and told Burt (my landlord's son, the actual property owner) whatever lies would make enough confusion to cover up what he'd done.

In July of 2021, my landlords were worried Randy would build a ramp he had been repeatedly told not to build.  The barricade was typical of him - attrition, battery, lies and confusion.

In August of 2021, he repeated it all, screening in the front of the porch - another barricade people couldn't see through - because witnesses testified to what they saw Randy do on the porch.

In October 2021, he repeated it all again - building a chain link cage barricade.
