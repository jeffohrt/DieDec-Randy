Randy regularly (photos in the repo) rinses the recycling on the porch - throwing food and water into the driveway.  Iâ€™ve only seen him do it once in the backyard - when the porch was too full of furniture.

Randy is dumping food waste, from hundreds of people, in the driveway or backyard every time he rinses his recycling.  His record is 6000 bottles, 300 beer bottles, sitting, baking in the sun for months, before being rinsed and dumped on the property.

Randy regularly throws unfinished food and drinks into the driveway.  He claims he is feeding the birds (crows, seagulls and pigeons).  Randy charges out of his house any chance he gets to assault me.  On several occasions he has been so angry he has come with only a sandwich to scream at me.  He has thrown his sandwiches at me several times.

On Dec 15th 2021, he became so angry he tried to throw it through the chain link wall.  It bounced off, Randy picked it up and threw it into the driveway in front of the trolley Fay had left on the sidewalk to harass Randy.  It sat for days - until the rain washed it away.
