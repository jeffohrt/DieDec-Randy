On July 22nd, 2021, my landlord and I testified (seperately), under oath (the recordings are in the Court Recordings folder) that Randy assaults, harasses and threatens women in particular.  My landlord (a woman) and I both testified that Randy 'works himself up' to assault someone.

During court (July 22nd) 2 female witnesses grew confused and upset - neither had testified before - both were anxious - but they grew more confused and upset by Randy's actions in court and the courthouse waiting room.

Randy sobbed and cried while men testified, including myself and himself.  These men (not Randy and I) talked about it in the waiting room.
Randy grew so agitated while women testified, that he had to be chastised by the Judge multiple times.  He had to be reminded to stay behind his desk and not to rush around the desk because of the Sheriffs in the room.
Randy grew so agitated while women testified, that Sheriffs left their posts at the back of the room and stood behind Randy, reminding him not to rush around the desk.
Randy grew so agitated while questioning his landlord (a woman) about his reputation for assaulting, harassing and threatening tenants,  his reputation for damaging apartments when evicted and his inability to rent anywhere else in Liverpool because of those reputations that he began threatening his previous landlords while questioning his current landlord.  It's all in the court recordings.

The action that upset the witnesses the most - Randy would skip, sing and throw 'thumbs up' to his witnesses each time he went to the washroom or court recessed for a break ... only to sob and cry in court a second later.  It's all threatrics.  The only thing in court that was truly Randy - was his visible hatred of and desire to physically intimidate the female witnesses.
