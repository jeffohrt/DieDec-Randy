On January 13th 2022 I was called to my apartment by my landlords at 11 am.

I arrived and was told Randy had been complaining of the sound of water running and was 'milling around'.  They remembered my request to not trust him and called me to come to my apartment to confirm my apartment was clean and dry.

Wayne was in the driveway, as polite and respectful as if nothing in the last year had happened.  He had no problems in his apartment but could also hear water running.

Randy was hanging around and came into the hallway when I was opening my apartment.

I entered my apartment and moved to allow Art, my landlord, in.  Randy pushed past Wayne, pushed my landlord to the side and tried to enter my apartment.

3 times I had to tell him - No - get out - as he entered my apartment.  Only stepping towards him forced him back into the door way.  A 4th "Get Out, You aren't allowed here." got him to leave.

Randy's parting comment - "Fuck him, fuck his apartment, let it freeze."

I notified Berle, my other landlord, asking that I be called, day or night, to be present when repairmen entered the apartment.
