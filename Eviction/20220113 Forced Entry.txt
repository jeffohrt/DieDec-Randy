On January 13th 2022 I was called to my apartment by my landlords at 11 am.

I arrived and was told Randy had been complaining of the sound of water running and was 'milling around'.  They remembered my request to not trust him and called me to come to my apartment to confirm my apartment was clean and dry.

Wayne was in the driveway, as polite and respectful as if nothing in the last year had happened.  He had no problems in his apartment but could also hear water running.

Randy was hanging around and came into the hallway when I was opening my apartment.

I entered my apartment and moved to allow Art, my landlord, in.  Randy pushed past Wayne and tried to push past my landlord and enter my apartment.

3 times I had to tell him - No - get out - as he tried to push past Art, my landlord, and enter my apartment.

Randy's parting comment to Wayne and my landlord - "Fuck him, fuck his apartment."

I notified my other landlord asking that I be called, day or night, to be present when repairmen entered the apartment.
