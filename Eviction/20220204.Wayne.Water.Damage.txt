The same day I found my Form D slid under my door - Wayne's bathroom continued to leak into my closet - damaging even more of my possessions.

On Feb 12th I received my power bill - the cost of cleaning up Wayne and Randy's messes and damages to my apartment was $600 - just in power - for carpet cleaners, heating fans and dehumidifiers.
