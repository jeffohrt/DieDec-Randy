One of the ongoing conflicts at 98 Union Street - is the constant stream of shopping trolleys that Fay uses to bring food bank donations and groceries to her apartment.

She has left them on the sidewalk since I have moved in - she does it to harass Randy.  Technically theft - it is more of a nuisance for the tenants.  Randy's OCD about owning and controling the porch and front of the house makes it Fay's easiest way to get back at Randy.

Randy has complained and reported her countless times.  The backyard was full of them in 2019, atleast half a dozen.

Fay stopped it from April 2021 until October 2021.  Fay was both upset and frightened when the Chain Link Wall was built because it is an extreme hazard to her because of her mobility issues.

The trolleys being left on the sidewalk started up again as Fay does petty things to get even with Randy while both pretend to be best friends.

I've uploaded a photo from Dec 15th.  Randy came out of his house to scream at me with only a sandwich.  He became so enraged by the trolley - he threw his sandwich at me, it bounced off the chain link wall.  He picked it up again and threw it at the trolley (on the sidewalk) in front of my apartment.
