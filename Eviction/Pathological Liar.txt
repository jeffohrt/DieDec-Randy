I was warned by everyone (landlords, tenants, neighbors and Randy's children) that Randy is a liar.  He is a pathological liar.

The full extent of his lying to cause chaos and confusion is compounded by his use of half truthes and exploitation of those around him with diminished capacity.  He is a predator and he hides by sobbing and crying and his idiotic claims that only cause more confusion.

There is no way to list every instance of Randy lying so I will list a few big ones.

Randy, Fay and Wayne have claimed, under oath (court testimony) that Randy has never attacked, harassed or threatened a tenant in the 10 years Randy has lived there (or the time Fay and Wayne have lived there).

Fay and Wayne have filed complaints with the landlords since they moved in about Randy's harassment and threats on and about the porch.  This is specifically true of Fay who was not allowed on Randy's furniture - it occupied the entire porch.  When I moved in, in 2019, Fay and Randy fought every day about Fay having to sit in the corner and only the corner, on a broken lawn chair Randy gave her and threatened to take away from her - daily.  Both lied about this in court.

In March / April of 2020 - before I had anything to do with Randy or anyone else, Randy called the RCMP on Fay and Cheezy after an argument over the porch and the chair.   Fay's chair had broken beyond use and Fay got a new one.  When Randy started threatening to take Fay's chair - she threatened to call the RCMP if Randy touched it because it was a different chair - not the one he had given her.  The RCMP arrived as I was leaving one morning.  I spoke with that RCMP officer before I had any involvement with any tenant.  I had been there for a year.  Fay and Randy have lied about all this in court.

RCMP case files (police reports), court documents and recordings have multiple people, including myself, claiming and corroborating each other - that each has been attacked by Randy, with and without weapons, with and without barricades, for extended periods of time.  In Jan 2022, it has been 17 months - I have been attacked for 17 months by a man using weapons and barricades.  My friend (Charley) was attacked for 7 months by Randy, with weapons like screwdrivers.  Claudia had a lawnmower blade thrown at her.

Court recordings of his landlords describe him attacking, harassing and threatening every tenant for 10 years.  That same testimony has Randy's landlord explaining Randy can't rent anywhere in Liverpool because he has acted that way and damaged property at his previous rentals.  The landlords have written notes and personal experience of and with that violence for 10 years.

Specific examples from court include Randy breaking into an apartment and photographing the contents to humiliate and tenant with schitzophrenia by circulating those photographs in town.

Specific examples from July 25th (the first time I speak to my landlords about Randy's past specific to court related matters) Randy targeted, harassed, attacked and threatened the woman in Apartment 3 (Fay's) before Fay.  Randy forced that tenant completely off the porch.  The tenant asked the landlords for permission to read in the backyard, it was given.  Randy stalked the woman everywhere she went, threatening, harrassing and attacking her every time she left her apartment.  He moved furniture to the backyard so he could sit and harass that woman.  In one particularly violent encounter that woman ran to her apartment and locked the door.  Randy was beating on the door and screaming threats when the woman locked herself in the bathroom and called the landlords.  They instructed the woman to call 911.  She did.  The RCMP attended and a case file exists.  Randy was given a special meeting with his landlords after this event and was told he was never to threaten a tenant again.
